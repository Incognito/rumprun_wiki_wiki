I work on many things.  Some sort of wishfully-thought short-term TODO list:

* fix _exit() to deal with threads [rumprun]
* unify the kernel and application memory pools [rumprun]
* support fork() [rumprun]
* ARM support [rumprun]
* re-abstract sysproxy transport to allow for non-socket implementations [rump kernels]
* fix all bugs [everywhere] (might take a while)
