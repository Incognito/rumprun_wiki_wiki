This page contains an overview of the project ideas, including their
difficulty and category (and is mostly TODO)

* more automated builds and tests, see [[Project ideas: build system improvements]]
* [[package resulting components in a packaging system|Project ideas: packaging]]
* create a Valgrind HOWTO (on this wiki) which details common pitfalls, tricks and tips
* convert librumpuser to use autoconf (or equivalent) instead of homegrown #ifdefs
* add auth support for remote clients
* [[OSX support|Project ideas: OSX support]]
* add support for "offline mode" tarballs to rumprun-posix, similar to what tarup.sh does for buildrump.sh
