Titles
------

To help find articles from the [page list](http://repo.rumpkernel.org/wiki/wiki/_pages),
use a page title of the form "Category: Subject".  See the page list for examples.

The current categories are:

* _Builds_: automated builds, tests, etc.
* _Howto_: Tutorials, howtos, guides, etc.
* _Performance_: important points about optimization, tuning, etc.
* _Project ideas_: detailed description of a project looking for idle hands.

If the article does not fit into the existing categories, please propose
a new category on the rumpkernel-users@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Additionally, the following categories exist, but they should be used
only if the respective code exists and is available:

* _Repo_: main pages for repositories hosted under http://repo.rumpkernel.org/
* _Platforms_: descriptions of platforms that rump kernels run on

Do not change titles after an article has been published, since that will
alter the article's URL and render any hyperlinks to the article invalid.

Linking
-------

Use the format \[\[text|article title\]\] to link to other articles on this wiki,
e.g. to link to this page you would use `[[guidelines|Wiki Guidelines]]`.
The advantage of this format is that dead links will be flagged when
the page is rendered.

To link to this wiki from an external source, use the URL `http://wiki.rumpkernel.org/article-name`,
e.g. http://wiki.rumpkernel.org/Wiki-Guidelines for this page.
To link to a rump kernel repository (currently hosted on Github), use `http://repo.rumpkernel.org/reponame`, e.g. http://repo.rumpkernel.org/buildrump.sh for buildrump.sh.  Avoid linking to
non-rumpkernel.org URLs.
