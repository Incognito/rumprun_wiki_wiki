* _Howto_: Tutorials, howtos, guides, etc.
* _Performance_: important points about optimization, tuning, etc.
* _Project idea_: detailed description of a project looking for idle hands.

If the article does not fit into the existing categories, please propose
a new category on the rumpkernel-users@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Additionally, the following categories exist, but they should be used
only if the respective code exists and is available:

* _Repo_: main pages for repositories hosted under github.com/rumpkernel
* _Platform_: descriptions of platforms that rump kernels run on
