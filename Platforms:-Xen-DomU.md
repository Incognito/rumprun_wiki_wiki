The Xen DomU platform allows running regular POSIX applications directly
as Xen guests.  It was the third platform supported by rump kernels
after userspace and the Linux kernel, and was the first platform to
support rumprun.

The source code is available from [the rumprun
repository](http://repo.rumpkernel.org/rumprun) under the
directory __platform/xen__.
