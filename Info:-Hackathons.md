* __November 26th, London__ (10am-5pm).  This hackathon will be held after the day of the http://operatingsystems.io/
  conference at [London Hackspace](https://london.hackspace.org.uk/).  No prior
registration is necessary, and you are welcome even if you are not attending
the conference.  In case some attendees refuse to stop hacking at 5pm, we will continue
in a cafe or "continue" in a pub.  If possible, come armed with your own problems that you would like to work on
and/or discuss.  (not required, we have plenty of varied problems available)
