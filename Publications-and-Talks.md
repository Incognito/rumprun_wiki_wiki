-   _Rump Kernels, Just Components_ talks about rump kernels as reusable
    and platform-agnostic drivers.  The intended audience is developers.  The

    and [slides](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/01_uk_rump_kernels/attachments/slides/398/export/events/attachments/01_uk_rump_kernels/slides/398/fosdem2014.pdf) are available.
    Presented at FOSDEM 2014 (Microkernel devroom).
-   _The Anykernel and Rump Kernels_ gives a general overview and
    demonstrates rump kernels on Windows and in Firefox. The
    [video](http://video.fosdem.org/2013/maintracks/K.1.105/The_Anykernel_and_Rump_Kernels.webm),
    [slides](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/operating_systems_anykernel/attachments/slides/244/export/events/attachments/operating_systems_anykernel/slides/244/fosdem2013_rumpkern.pdf)
    and an
    [interview](https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/interviews/2013-antii-kantee/)
    are available. Presented at FOSDEM 2013 (Operating Systems track).

    and [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AJNxa33pzk)
    are available. Presented at AsiaBSDCon 2010.
-   _Fs-utils: File Systems Access Tools for Userland_ describes
    fs-utils, an mtools-like utility kit which uses rump kernel file
    systems as a backend. The
