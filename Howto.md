Pages with howtos and tutorials. The difference between the two:
- Howtos are specific and assume that you have general knowledge of
 rump kernels.
- Tutorials start from scratch and build towards a useful outcome.
 If you are new to rump kernels, following one or two tutorials
 should be you started.
